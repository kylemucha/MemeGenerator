# Meme Generator 😂

An interactive Web Application built using React that allows a user to randomly grab one of the top 100 memes on ImgFlip through the use of the ImgFlip API and change the Top and Bottom text to customize the meme to what the user would like to display.

# React Concepts Learned ⚛︎

- Controlled Components
  - This project utilizes controleld components since we wanted to update our state on every single keystroke of our input boxes. I also learned about the new ways React 19 is able to handle forms which are more intuitive than controlled components, but it is still useful in some cases.

- Functional Programming
  - This project showed how React adopted functional programming and helped me understand why side effects happen when developing in React.

- Fetching Data
  - This was my first time being able to fetch data through the ImgFlip API, pulling an array of objects that held the data of each meme that can display on the page.

- Side Effects
  - I was able to learn about side effects in React such as being able to pull data from outside sources in React such as use of API's.
